# To make this work for WSL then you need to 
# 1. Add hosts as shown below
# 2. Run "ssh-add path-to-private-key" once for every host you have added to the config
# After this initial ssh-add then keys should be persisted and you no longer have to run ssh-add every time you restart bash.

Host github.com
	HostName github.com
	User git
	PreferredAuthentications publickey
