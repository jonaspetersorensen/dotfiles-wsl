# Misc notes regarding ROS development environment

Some thoughts, ideas and harsh words about setting up a better development experience.

## Gazebo

### Clients

[x] Default gui client  
    I can get it to work in wsl, but it is really slow and it grabs 100% cpu at all times  

[x] Web client  
    http://gazebosim.org/gzweb.html

    A much better option as long as you manage to import all the models you need.  
    No more twidling with xserves etc, wsl will simply host the web server and you then browse from the windows side.

## ROS

Is it possible to run ROS distros as docker containers?
